# Music Player for AC Music (MPAM)
Just a bad python 3 script that plays music by the hour.
Designed for linux however I may make a windows version.


Dependences:

playsound
	
datetime (should be in python by default)


File directory is /home/AC Music (because when I add variables to playsound paths it throws me errors)

File Names are 01 AM, 02 AM, 11 AM etc.
